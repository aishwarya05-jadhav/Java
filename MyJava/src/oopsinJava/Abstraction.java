		  JAVA INTERFACES
		  
		  An interface is a fully abstract class. It includes a group of abstract methods(methods without body)
		  We use the interfac keyword to create an interface in Java
		  
		  Like abstract classes, we cannot create objects of interfaces.
		  To use an interface, other classes must implement it. We use the implements keyword to implement an interface
