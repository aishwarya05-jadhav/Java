		 JAVA PACKAGES
		 A package is simply a container that groups related types(Java classes, interfaces,
		 enumerations, and annotations)
		 
		 To define a package in Java, you use the keyword package.
		 Java uses file system directories to store packages
		 
		 IMPORTING A PACKAGE
		 
		 Java has an important statement that allows you to import an entire
		 package(as in earlier examples), or use only certain classes and interfaces defined in the package
		 
		 Eg---- import java.util.Date;		//imports only Date class
		 --------import java.io.*;          //imports everything inside java.io package
		 
		 In java, the import statement is written directly after the package statement and before the class definition
